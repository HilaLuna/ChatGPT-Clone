<h1> ChatGPT Clone </h1>

Clone project of chatGPT with its basic features.

<h2> Project Overview </h2>

This project at this early stage of my learning Javascript leverages the power of Javascript to enhance the interactivity and functionality of the application. Now we have a dynamic and engaging user-experience at hand. 

<h2> Technologies Used </h2> </br>

<ul>
    
<li> HTML5 </li> </br>

<li> CSS </li> </br>

<li> JavaScript </li> </br>

</ul>

<h2> Features </h2>

<ul>

<li> API Integration with API Key </li> </br>

    Utilizing JavaScript, we've integrated ChatGPT's own APIs that we created to fetch and display real-time data.

<li> Return Feature for Functionality </li> </br>

    This project employs JavaScript's return statement's basic use within functions which contributes to a more organized and scalable codebase.

<li> Request Options </li> </br>

    When making the request, we used POST in the method option and experimented our use of API keys.

<li> Try-Catch </li> </br>

    To create a more resilient application, we've implemented the try-catch mechanism in JavaScript. This ensures handling of errors, preventing potential crashes and providing clear feedback to users or developers about unexpected issues.


<li> Async-Await </li> </br>

    In this project, we employed JavaScript's async-await feature for handling asynchronous tasks, such as fetching data or performing time-consuming operations. This results in cleaner and more readable code, simplifying the management of asynchronous workflows.

</ul>
